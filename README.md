Hey there! 

This repo was made for Enhancing User interfaces with animations in React presentation.

To run locally use `yarn;yarn dev` as usual.

In this examples i used

- [ReactTransitionGroup](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/)

- [React-spring](https://www.react-spring.dev/)

- [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

- [GSAP](https://gsap.com/)


Also i tried to collect info from different websites and created an article to help beginers to understand animations in general.

Check it out https://seasoned-straw-0fe.notion.site/Enhancing-User-Interfaces-with-CSS-Animations-in-React-6e802d24f1c64ad28f4c444605b18743

I know that this is not everything you need to know about animations. If you have something to add, let's do it together.

Looking forward for the feedback!
